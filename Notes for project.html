		<div class="one-1">
			<p>The Web is made up of many computers that communicate with each other. When you attempt
			to visit a web page like <a href="http://www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a> , your computer
			sends an HTTP request to the Udacity server. The Udacity server find the HTML document you 
			requested and it sends it back to your computer where your web browser interprets the page 
			and it displays the content on your screen.

			What is HTML?<br>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. HTML documents contain text that 
			tells your web browser how the webpage should look.

			HTML tells your computer how to display content by using tags and elements. HTML is structured
			like a tree, it starts with the larger portions and works down to smaller and smaller branches,
			you can have tags with in tags.  Examples of a tag would be div most tags have an opening and
			a closing tag. Your HTML code has to have the correct syntax or your web browser may display
			the content incorrectly. This is because computers simply display what you tell them. If it is
			incorrect it will be incorrect on your screen. 

			There are inline and block elements. The difference between the two are:
			Inline elements simply display in a straight line. Block elements are incased in a "invisible 
			box" that surrounds the contents inside of them. CSS or "Cascading Style sheets" are a separate 
			file that links to your HTML file to provide styles, colors, spacing, and positioning to your 
			website. Using CSS rather than embedding styles into your HTML can be a great tool to prevent 
			repetition by using class tags to your elements.</p>

		<h2 id="lesson2" class="bold">Lesson 2: Creating a structured document with HTML</h2>
		<div class="one-1">	
			<p>HTML is structured like a tree. You can have many different branches, you can have elements 
			within elements. You can have boxes within other boxes.
			HTML should be written starting with your largest tags and working down and to the right.
			If you are placing an element within an element you should tab the child element to show the 
			difference between the two. Each child element is denoted with a triangle. Clicking each 
			triangle shows another child element. When writing HTML is it best to use a text editor like
			sublime rather than note pad. Sublime helps by guiding you through the tags. if you start an 
			opening tag it will create a closing tag automatically. It also changes the colors of the
			various elements to help you spot them.</p>

		<h2 id="lesson3" class="bold">Lesson 3: CSS</h2>
		<div class="one-1" id="lesson-3-1">
			<p>CSS is a useful programming tool. Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is used to add style, color,
			position, etc to your web page. You can embed this information to your HTML but you will have a 
			lot of repetition. You can give you elements "classes" then when you want to add these
			attributes to other areas of your web page you can just add that class to different elements. 
			This stops repetition when coding.</p>
