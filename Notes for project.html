		<div class="one-1">
			The Web is made up of many computers that communicate with each other. When you attempt to visit a web page like <a href="http://www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a> , your computer sends an HTTP request to the Udacity server. The Udacity server find the HTML document you requested and it sends it back to your computer where your web browser interprets the page and it displays the content on your screen.

			What is HTML? HTML stands for hypertext markup language. HTML documents contain text that tells your web browser how the webpage should look.

			HTML tells your computer how to display content by using tags and elements. Examples of a tag would be div most tags have an opening and a closing tag. Your HTML code has to have the correct syntax or your web browser may display the content incorrectly. This is because computers simply display what you tell them. If it is incorrect it will be incorrect on your screen. 

			There are inline and block elements. The difference between the two are:
			Inline elements simply display in a straight line. Block elements are incased in a "invisible box" that surrounds the contents inside of them.

		<h2 id=lesson2 class="bold">Lesson 2: Creating a structured document with HTML</h2>
		<div class="two-1">	
			HTML is structured like a tree. You can have many different branches, you can have elements within elements. You can have boxes within other boxes.
			HTML should be written starting with your largest tags and working down and to the right. If you are placing an element within an element you should tab the child element to show the difference between the two. Each child element is denoted with a triangle. Clicking each triangle shows another child element. When writing HTML is it best to use a text editor like sublime rather than note pad. Sublime helps by guiding you through the tags. if you start an opening tag it will create a closing tag automatically. It also changes the colors of the various elements to help you spot them

		<h2 id=lesson3 class="bold">Lesson 3: CSS</h2>
		<div class="three-1" id="lesson-3-1">
			CSS is a useful programming tool. Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is used to add style, color, posistion, etc to your web page. You can embed this information to your HTML but you will have a lot of repetition. You can give you elements "classes" then when you want to add these attributes to other areas of your web page you can just add that class to different elements. This stops repetition when coding.
